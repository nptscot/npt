The aim of the code in this document is to test the DataZones files, starting with the v2024-07-02 release.
Get that with:


```{bash}
#| eval: false
cd outputdata
gh release download v2024-07-02 --clobber
```

The code above automatically downloads the data from this release: https://github.com/nptscot/outputdata/releases/tag/v2024-07-02
