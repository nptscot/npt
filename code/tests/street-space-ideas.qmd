We need to classify roads by width.
In the first instance we will assume there no on street parking.

A toggle can be used to switch between whether or not there is on street parking.

Another toggle can be used to switch whether or not we're supplying the space by reallocation of a lane.

A dropdown menu will allow the user to select the intervention type from the following options (in the What column)

| What                                                                  | Not enough below            | May be enough | Enough space |
